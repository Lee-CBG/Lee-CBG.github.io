The Biocomputing Group is an interdisciplinary team of biologists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists, software developers and software engineers. Each member of the lab is trained to use computational biology approaches to address research questions relating to cancer biology and precision cancer medicine. We train students and post-docs with a biology background that would like to develop bioinformatics skills. We are equally interested in trainees with a computer science background that would like to apply these skills to studying cancer biology and improving patient outcomes.
