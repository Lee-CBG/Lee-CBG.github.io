My research interests lie at the fascinating crossroads of computational biology and large language models, with a particular emphasis on the field of cost-effective T cell immunotherapy. My work seeks to shed light on two key areas: first, developing computational strategies for accurate prediction of the binding affinity between T cell receptors (TCRs) and epitope sequences presented on abnormal cells; second, designing/generating TCR sequences tailored for personalized immunotherapy. This field holds the potential to substantially expedite and reduce the cost of wet-lab experiments, paving the way for solutions to a wide array of diseases.",
