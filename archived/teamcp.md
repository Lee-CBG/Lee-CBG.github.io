He received undergraduate degrees in mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago. He performed graduate studies in the fields of Diabetes and Cancer Metabolism and received his PhD from the Committee on Molecular Metabolism and Nutrition and the University of Chicago. He also spent time working in IT as well as teaching science and mathematics, and received the Wayne C. Booth graduate student prize for excellence in teaching while at University of Chicago. His interests include applying and developing mathematical techniques to areas of basic and clinical cancer research, and at the Griffith Lab, his projects include working on the <a href="http://civicdb.org">Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC)</a> knowledgebase, as well as characterization of novel mutations important for cancer which exist in non-coding space.' image="/assets/img/team/arpad_danos.jpg" role="Instructor in Medicine" %} -->

My research interests lie at the fascinating crossroads of computational biology and large language models, with a particular emphasis on the field of cost-effective T cell immunotherapy.

My work seeks to shed light on two key areas: first, developing computational strategies for accurate prediction of the binding affinity between T cell receptors (TCRs) and epitope sequences presented on abnormal cells; second, designing/generating TCR sequences tailored for personalized immunotherapy. This field holds the potential to substantially expedite and reduce the cost of wet-lab experiments, paving the way for solutions to a wide array of diseases.' image="/assets/img/team/pengfei.jpg" role="Postdoctoral Researcher" %}

<!-- {% include team_member member_name="Katie" full_name="Katie Campbell, Phd" bio='Katie is currently a post doctoral fellow in the Ribas lab at UCLA but continues part time in the lab. Katie completed her PhD in the Molecular Cell Biology program at Washington University in St. Louis in 2018. She graduated from Penn State University in 2014 with honors in Biochemistry. Katie has been awarded positions in the Precision Medicine and Cancer Biology Pathways at Washington University, and is interested in utilizing genomics and informatics approaches to study cancer and tumor immunology in order to understand mechanisms of drug and treatment sensitivity. Her thesis research is focused on characterizing models of and defining therapeutic opportunities in head and neck cancer. Katie has also contributed to other projects in the lab, including <a href="http://civicdb.org">CIViC</a>, <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GenVisR.html">GenVisR</a>, pVACtools, and <a href="http://dgidb.org">DGIdb</a>, as well as analyzing cancer case studies for the Washington University Genomics Tumor Board.
